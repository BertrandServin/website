abstract: Eusocial insects are crucial to many ecosystems, and particularly the honeybee
  (Apis mellifera). One approach to facilitate their study in molecular genetics,
  is to consider whole-colony genotyping by combining DNA of multiple individuals
  in a single pool sequencing experiment. Cheap and fast, this technique comes with
  the drawback of producing data requiring dedicated methods to be fully exploited.
  Despite this limitation, pool sequencing data have been shown to be informative
  and cost-effective when working on random mating populations. Here, we present new
  statistical methods for exploiting pool sequencing of eusocial colonies in order
  to reconstruct the genotypes of the queen of such colony. This leverages the possibility
  to monitor genetic diversity, perform genomic-based studies or implement selective
  breeding. Using simulations and honeybee real data, we show that the new methods
  allow for a fast and accurate estimation of the queen's genetic ancestry, with correlations
  of about 0.9 to that obtained from individual genotyping. Also, it allows for an
  accurate reconstruction of the queen genotypes, with about 2% genotyping error.
  We further validate these inferences using experimental data on colonies with both
  pool sequencing and individual genotyping of drones. In brief, in this study we
  present statistical models to accurately estimate the genetic ancestry and reconstruct
  the genotypes of the queen from pool sequencing data from workers of an eusocial
  colony. Such information allows to exploit pool sequencing for traditional population
  genetics analyses, association studies and for selective breeding. While validated
  in Apis mellifera, these methods are applicable to other eusocial hymenopterans.
