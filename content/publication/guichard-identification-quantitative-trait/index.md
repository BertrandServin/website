abstract: The identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) through genome-wide
  association studies (GWAS) is a powerful method for unravelling the genetic background
  of selected traits and improving early-stage predictions. In honey bees (Apis mellifera),
  past genetic analyses have particularly focused on individual queens and workers.
  In this study, we used pooled whole-genome sequences to ascertain the genetic variation
  of the entire colony. In total, we sampled 216 Apis mellifera mellifera and 28 Apis
  mellifera carnica colonies. Different experts subjectively assessed the gentleness
  and calmness of the colonies using a standardised protocol. Conducting a GWAS for
  calmness on 211 purebred A. m. mellifera colonies, we identified three QTL, on chromosomes
  8, 6, and 12. The two first QTL correspond to LOC409692 gene, coding for a disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10, and to Abscam gene, coding for
  a Dscam family member Abscam protein, respectively. The last gene has been reported
  to be involved in the domestication of A. mellifera. The third QTL is located 13
  kb upstream of LOC102655631, coding for a trehalose transporter. For gentleness,
  two QTL were identified on chromosomes 4 and 3. They are located within gene LOC413669,
  coding for a lap4 protein, and gene LOC413416, coding for a bicaudal C homolog 1-B
  protein, respectively. The identified positional candidate genes of both traits
  mainly affect the olfaction and nervous system of honey bees. Further research is
  needed to confirm the results and to better understand the genetic and phenotypic
  basis of calmness and gentleness.
