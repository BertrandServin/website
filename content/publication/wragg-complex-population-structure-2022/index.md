abstract: Honey bee subspecies originate from specific geographical areas in Africa,
  Europe and the Middle East, and beekeepers interested in specific phenotypes have
  imported genetic material to regions outside of the bees' original range for use
  either in pure lines or controlled crosses. Moreover, imported drones are present
  in the environment and mate naturally with queens from the local subspecies. The
  resulting admixture complicates population genetics analyses, and population stratification
  can be a major problem for association studies. To better understand Western European
  honey bee populations, we produced a whole genome sequence and single nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP) genotype data set from 870 haploid drones and demonstrate its
  utility for the identification of nine genetic backgrounds and various degrees of
  admixture in a subset of 629 samples. Five backgrounds identified correspond to
  subspecies, two to isolated populations on islands and two to managed populations.
  We also highlight several large haplotype blocks, some of which coincide with the
  position of centromeres. The largest is 3.6 Mb long and represents 21% of chromosome
  11, with two major haplotypes corresponding to the two dominant genetic backgrounds
  identified. This large naturally phased data set is available as a single vcf file
  that can now serve as a reference for subsequent populations genomics studies in
  the honey bee, such as (i) selecting individuals of verified homogeneous genetic
  backgrounds as references, (ii) imputing genotypes from a lower-density data set
  generated by an SNP-chip or by low-pass sequencing, or (iii) selecting SNPs compatible
  with the requirements of genotyping chips.
