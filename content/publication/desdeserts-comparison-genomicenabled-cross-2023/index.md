abstract: A crucial step in inbred plant breeding is the choice of mating design to
  derive high-performing inbred varieties while also maintaining a competitive breeding
  population to secure sufficient genetic gain in future generations. In practice,
  the mating design usually relies on crosses involving the best parental inbred lines
  to ensure high mean progeny performance. This excludes crosses involving lower performing
  but more complementary parents in terms of favorable alleles. We predicted the ability
  of crosses to produce putative outstanding progenies (high mean and high variance
  progeny distribution) using genomic prediction models. This study compared the benefits
  and drawbacks of seven genomic cross selection criteria (CSC) in terms of genetic
  gain for one trait and genetic diversity in the next generation. Six CSC were already
  published and we propose an improved CSC that can estimate the proportion of progeny
  above a threshold defined for the whole mating plan. We simulated mating designs
  optimized using different CSC. The 835 elite parents came from a real breeding program
  and were evaluated between 2000 and 2016. We applied constraints on parental contributions
  and genetic similarities between selected parents according to usual breeder practices.
  Our results showed that CSC based on progeny variance estimation increased the genetic
  value of superior progenies by up to 5% in the next generation compared to CSC based
  on the progeny mean estimation (i.e. parental genetic values) alone. It also increased
  the genetic gain (up to 4%) and/or maintained more genetic diversity at QTLs (up
  to 4% more genic variance when the marker effects were perfectly estimated).
