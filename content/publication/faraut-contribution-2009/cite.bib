 abstract = {\textlessp\textgreaterRadiation hybrid mapping has emerged in the end of the 1990 s as a successful and complementary approach to map genomes, essentially because of its ability to bridge the gaps between genetic and clone-based physical maps, but also using comparative mapping approaches, between gene-rich and gene-poor maps. Since its early development in human, radiation hybrid mapping played a pivotal role in the process of mapping animal genomes, especially mammalian ones. We review here all the different steps involved in radiation hybrid mapping from the constitution of panels to the construction of maps. A description of its contribution to whole genome maps with a special emphasis on domestic animals will also be presented. Finally, current applications of radiation hybrid mapping in the context of whole genome assemblies will be described.\textless/p\textgreater},
