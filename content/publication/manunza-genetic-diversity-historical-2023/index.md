abstract: In the last decade, several studies aimed at dissecting the genetic architecture
  of local small ruminant breeds to discover which variations are involved in the
  process of adaptation to environmental conditions, a topic that has acquired priority
  due to climate change. Considering that traditional breeds are a reservoir of such
  important genetic variation, improving the current knowledge about their genetic
  diversity and origin is the first step forward in designing sound conservation guidelines.
  The genetic composition of North-Western European archetypical goat breeds is still
  poorly exploited. In this study we aimed to fill this gap investigating goat breeds
  across Ireland and Scandinavia, including also some other potential continental
  sources of introgression. The PCA and Admixture analyses suggest a well-defined
  cluster that includes Norwegian and Swedish breeds, while the crossbred Danish landrace
  is far apart, and there appears to be a close relationship between the Irish and
  Saanen goats. In addition, both graph representation of historical relationships
  among populations  and f4-ratio statistics suggest a certain degree of gene flow
  between the Norse and Atlantic landraces. Furthermore, we identify signs of ancient
  admixture events of Scandinavian origin in the Irish and in the Icelandic goats.
  The time when these migrations, and consequently the introgression, of Scandinavian-like
  alleles occurred, can be traced back to the Viking colonisation of these two isles
  during the Viking Age (793-1066 CE). The demographic analysis indicates a complicated
  history of these traditional breeds with signatures of bottleneck, inbreeding and
  crossbreeding with the improved breeds. Despite~these recent demographic changes
  and the historical genetic background shaped by centuries of human-mediated gene
  flow, most of them~maintained~their~genetic~identity, becoming an irreplaceable
  genetic resource as well as a cultural heritage.
