 abstract = {Correlation between expression level of the bovine DNAJA1 gene and meat tenderness was recently found in Charolais longissimus thoracis muscle samples, suggesting that this gene could play an important role in meat tenderness. Here, we report the validation of polymorphisms within the bovine DNAJA1 gene, and the haplotype variability and extent of linkage disequilibrium in the three main French beef breeds (Blonde dAquitaine, Charolais, Limousin). Genotyping 18 putative SNPs revealed that 16 SNPs were polymorphic within the breeds tested. Two SNPs were removed from further analyses as one SNP had a low genotyping call rate, while the other SNP was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The degree of heterozygosity observed for the remaining 14 SNPs varied between breeds, with Charolais being the breed with the highest genetic variation and Blonde dAquitaine the lowest. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype structure of DNAJA1 were different between breeds. Eighteen different haplotypes, including three shared by all breeds, were discovered, and two to three tag SNPs (depending on the breed) are sufficient to capture all the genetic variability seen in these haplotypes. The results of this study will facilitate the design of optimal future association studies evaluating the role of the DNAJA1 gene in meat tenderness.},
