abstract: 'The admixture of domestic pig into French wild boar populations has been
  monitored since the 1980s thanks to the existence of a cytogenetic difference between
  the two sub-species. The number of chromosomes is 2n = 36 in wild boar and 2n =
  38 in pig, respectively. This difference makes it possible to assign the “hybrid”
  status to wild boar individuals controlled with 37 or 38 chromosomes. However, it
  does not make it possible to determine the timing of the hybridization(s), nor to
  guarantee the absence of domestic admixture in an animal with 2n = 36 chromosomes.
  In order to analyze hybridization in greater detail and to avoid the inherent limitations
  of the cytogenetic approach, 362 wild boars (WB) recently collected in different
  French geographical areas and in different environments (farms, free ranging in
  protected or unprotected areas, animals with 2n = 36, 37 or 38 chromosomes) were
  genotyped on a 70K SNP chip. Principal component analyses allowed the identification
  of 13 “outliers” (3.6%), for which the proportion of the genome of “domestic” origin
  was greater than 40% (Admixture analyses). These animals were probably recent hybrids,
  having Asian domestic pig ancestry for most of them. For the remaining 349 animals
  studied, the proportion of the genome of “wild” origin varied between 83% and 100%
  (median: 94%). This proportion varied significantly depending on how the wild boar
  populations were managed. Local ancestry analyses revealed adaptive introgression
  from domestic pig, suggesting a critical role of genetic admixture in improving
  the fitness and population growth of WB. Overall, our results show that the methods
  used to monitor the domestic genetic contributions to wild boar populations should
  evolve in order to limit the level of admixture between the two gene pools.'
