abstract: "BACKGROUND: Goat populations that are characterized within
the AdaptMap project cover a large part of the worldwide distribution
of this species and provide the opportunity to assess their diversity
at a global scale. We analysed genome-wide 50 K single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) data from 144 populations to describe the global
patterns of molecular variation, compare them to those observed in
other livestock species, and identify the drivers that led to the
current distribution of
goats.RESULTS: A high
degree of genetic variability exists among the goat populations
studied. Our results highlight a strong partitioning of molecular
diversity between and within continents. Three major gene pools
correspond to goats from Europe, Africa and West Asia. Dissection of
sub-structures disclosed regional gene pools, which reflect the main
post-domestication migration routes. We also identified several
exchanges, mainly in African populations, and which often involve
admixed and cosmopolitan breeds. Extensive gene flow has taken place
within specific areas (e.g., south Europe, Morocco and Mali-Burkina
Faso-Nigeria), whereas elsewhere isolation due to geographical
barriers (e.g., seas or mountains) or human management has decreased
local gene flows. CONCLUSIONS: After domestication in the Fertile
Crescent in the early Neolithic era (ca. 12,000 YBP), domestic goats
that already carried differentiated gene pools spread to Europe,
Africa and Asia. The spread of these populations determined the major
genomic background of the continental populations, which currently
have a more marked subdivision than that observed in other ruminant
livestock species. Subsequently, further diversification occurred at
the regional level due to geographical and reproductive isolation,
which was accompanied by additional migrations and/or importations,
the traces of which are still detectable today. The effects of breed
formation were clearly detected, particularly in Central and North
Europe. Overall, our results highlight a remarkable diversity that
occurs at the global scale and is locally partitioned and often
affected by introgression from cosmopolitan breeds. These findings
support the importance of long-term preservation of goat diversity,
and provide a useful framework for investigating adaptive
introgression, directing genetic improvement and choosing breeding
targets."
