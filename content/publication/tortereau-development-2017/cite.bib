 abstract = {\textlessp\textgreater\textbfBACKGROUND: The efficiency of breeding programs partly relies on the accuracy of the estimated breeding values which decreases when pedigrees are incomplete. Two reproduction techniques are mainly used by sheep breeders to identify the sires of lambs: animal insemination and natural matings with a single ram per group of ewes. Both methods have major drawbacks, notably time-consuming tasks for breeders, and are thus used at varying levels in breeding programs. As a consequence, the percentage of known sires can be very low in some breeds and results in less accurate estimated breeding values.\textless/p\textgreater\textlessp\textgreater\textbfRESULTS: In order to address this issue and offer an alternative strategy for obtaining parentage information, we designed a set of 249 SNPs for parentage assignment in French sheep breeds and tested its efficiency in one breed. The set was derived from the 54Â K SNP chip that was used to genotype the thirty main French sheep populations. Only SNPs in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, displaying the highest Minor Allele Frequency across all the thirty populations and not associated with Mendelian errors in verified family trios were selected. The panel of 249 SNPs was successfully used in an on-farm test in the BMC breed and resulted in more than 95% of lambs being assigned to a unique sire.\textless/p\textgreater\textlessp\textgreater\textbfCONCLUSION: In this study we developed a SNP panel for assignment that achieved good results in the on-farm testing. We also raised some conditions for optimal use of this panel: at least 180 SNPs should be used and a minute preparation of the list of candidate sires. Our panel also displays high levels of MAF in the SheepHapMap breeds, particularly in the South West European breeds.\textless/p\textgreater},
