abstract: In the fight against the Varroa destructor mite, selective breeding of honey
  bee (Apis mellifera L.) populations that are resistant to the parasitic mite stands
  as a sustainable solution. Selection initiatives indicate that using the suppressed
  mite reproduction (SMR) trait as a selection criterion is a suitable tool to breed
  such resistant bee populations. We conducted a large European experiment to evaluate
  the SMR trait in different populations of honey bees spread over 13 different countries,
  and representing different honey bee genotypes with their local mite parasites.
  The first goal was to standardize and validate the SMR evaluation method, and then
  to compare the SMR trait between the different populations. Simulation results indicate
  that it is necessary to examine at least 35 single-infested cells to reliably estimate
  the SMR score of any given colony. Several colonies from our dataset display high
  SMR scores indicating that this trait is present within the European honey bee populations.
  The trait is highly variable between colonies and some countries, but no major differences
  could be identified between countries for a given genotype, or between genotypes
  in different countries. This study shows the potential to increase selective breeding
  efforts of V. destructor resistant populations.
