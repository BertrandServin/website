abstract: 'Sheep farming is a major source of meat in Morocco and plays a key role
  in the country’s agriculture. This study aims at characterizing the whole-genome
  diversity and demographic history of the main Moroccan sheep breeds, as well as
  to identify selection signatures within and between breeds. Whole genome data from
  87 individuals representing the five predominant local breeds were used to estimate
  their level of neutral genetic diversity and to infer the variation of their effective
  population size over time. In addition, we used two methods to detect selection
  signatures: either for detecting selective sweeps within each breed separately or
  by detecting differentially selected regions by contrasting different breeds. We
  identified hundreds of genomic regions putatively under selection, which related
  to several biological terms involved in local adaptation or the expression of zootechnical
  performances such as Growth, UV protection, Cell maturation or Feeding behavior.
  The results of this study revealed selection signatures in genes that have an important
  role in traits of interest and increased our understanding of how genetic diversity
  is distributed in these local breeds. Thus, Moroccan local sheep breeds exhibit
  both a high genetic diversity and a large set of adaptive variations, and therefore,
  represent a valuable genetic resource for the conservation of sheep in the context
  of climate change.'
