abstract: Small ruminants are suited to a wide variety of habitats and thus represent
  promising study models for identifying genes underlying adaptations. Here, we considered
  local Mediterranean breeds of goats (n,=,17) and sheep (n,=,25) from Italy, France
  and Spain. Based on historical archives, we selected the breeds potentially most
  linked to a territory and defined their original cradle (i.e., the geographical
  area in which the breed has emerged), including transhumant pastoral areas. We then
  used the programs PCAdapt and LFMM to identify signatures of artificial and environmental
  selection. Considering cradles instead of current GPS coordinates resulted in a
  greater number of signatures identified by the LFMM analysis. The results, combined
  with a systematic literature review, revealed a set of genes with potentially key
  adaptive roles in relation to the gradient of aridity and altitude. Some of these
  genes have been previously implicated in lipid metabolism (SUCLG2, BMP2), hypoxia
  stress/lung function (BMPR2), seasonal patterns (SOX2, DPH6) or neuronal function
  (TRPC4, TRPC6). Selection signatures involving the PCDH9 and KLH1 genes, as well
  as NBEA/NBEAL1, were identified in both species and thus could play an important
  adaptive role.
