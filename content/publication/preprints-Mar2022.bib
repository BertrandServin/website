  abstract = {Background Eusocial insects play a central role in many ecosystems, and particularly the important pollinator honeybee (Apis mellifera). One approach to facilitate their study in molecular genetics, is to consider whole colonies as single individuals by combining DNA of multiple individuals in a single pool sequencing experiment. Such a technique comes with the drawback of producing data requiring dedicated analytical methods to be fully exploited. Despite this limitation, pool sequencing data has been shown to be informative and cost-effective when working on random mating populations. Here, we present new statistical methods for exploiting pool sequencing data of eusocial colonies in order to reconstruct the genotype of the colony founder, the queen. This leverages the possibility to monitor genetic diversity, perform genomic-based studies or implement selective breeding.Results Using simulations and honeybee real data, we show that the methods allow for a fast and accurate estimation of the genetic ancestry, with correlations of 0.9 with that obtained from individual genotyping, and for an accurate reconstruction of the queen genotype, with 2\% genotyping error. We further validate the inference using experimental data on colonies with both pool sequencing and individual genotyping of drones.Conclusion In this study we present statistical models to accurately estimate the genetic ancestry and reconstruct the genotype of the queen from pool sequencing data from workers of an eusocial colony. Such information allows to exploit pool sequencing for traditional population genetics, association studies and selective breeding. While validated in Apis mellifera, these methods are applicable to other eusocial hymenoptera species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Background Intensive selection of modern pig breeds resulted in genetic improvement of productive traits while local pig breeds remained less performant. As they have been bred in extensive systems, they have adapted to specifical environmental conditions resulting in a rich genotypic and phenotypic diversity. In this study, European local pig breeds were genotypically and phenotypically characterised using DNA-pool sequencing data and breed level phenotypes related to stature, fatness, growth and reproductive performance traits. These data were analysed using a dedicated approach to detect selection signatures linked to phenotypic traits in order to uncover potential candidate genes that may be under adaptation to specific environments.Results Genetic data analysis of European pig breeds revealed four main axes of genetic variation represented by Iberian and modern breeds (i.e. Large White, Landrace, and Duroc). In addition, breeds clustered according to their geographical origin, for example French Gascon and Basque breeds, Italian Apulo Calabrese and Casertana breeds, Spanish Iberian and Portuguese Alentejano breeds. Principal component analysis of phenotypic data distinguished between larger and leaner breeds with better growth potential and reproductive performance on one hand and breeds that were smaller, fatter, and had low growth and reproductive efficiency on the other hand. Linking selection signatures with phenotype identified 561 significant genomic regions. Among them, several regions contained candidate genes with possible biological effect on stature, fatness, growth and reproduction performance traits. For example, strong associations were found for stature in two regions containing ANXA4 and ANTXR1 genes, for growth performance containing TLL1 gene, for fatness containing DNMT3A and POMC genes and for reproductive performance containing HSD17B7 gene.Conclusions The present study on European local pig breeds used a newly developed approach for searching selection signatures supported by phenotypic data at the breed level to identify potential candidate genes that may have adapted to different living environments and production systems. Results can be useful to define conservation programs of local pig breeds.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Honey bee subspecies originate from specific geographic areas in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. The interest of beekeepers in specific phenotypes has led them to import subspecies to regions outside of their original range. The resulting admixture complicates population genetics analyses and population stratification can be a major problem for association studies. As a typical example, the case of the French population is studied here. We sequenced 870 haploid drones for SNP detection and identified nine genetic backgrounds in 629 samples. Five correspond to subspecies, two to isolated populations and two to human-mediated population management. We also highlight several large haplotype blocks, some of which coincide with the position of centromeres. The largest is 3.6 Mb long on chromosome 11, representing 1.6 \% of the genome and has two major haplotypes, corresponding to the two dominant genetic backgrounds identified.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
