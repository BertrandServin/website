abstract: Reciprocal exchanges of DNA (crossovers) that occur during meiosis are mandatory
  to ensure the production of fertile gametes in sexually reproducing species. They
  also contribute to shuffle parental alleles into new combinations thereby fueling
  genetic variation and evolution. However, due to biological constraints, the recombination
  landscape is highly heterogeneous along the genome which limits the range of allelic
  combinations and the adaptability of populations. An approach to better understand
  the constraints on the recombination process is to study how it evolved in the past.
  In this work, we tackled this question by constructing recombination profiles in
  four diverging bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) populations established from 371
  landraces genotyped at 200,062 SNPs. We used linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns
  to estimate in each population the past distribution of recombination along the
  genome and characterize its fine-scale heterogeneity. At the megabase scale, recombination
  rates derived from LD patterns were consistent with family-based estimates obtained
  from a population of 406 recombinant inbred lines. Among the four populations, recombination
  landscapes were positively correlated between each other and shared a statistically
  significant proportion of highly recombinant intervals. However, this comparison
  also highlighted that the similarity in recombination landscapes between populations
  was significantly decreasing with their genetic differentiation in most regions
  of the genome. This observation was found to be robust to SNPs ascertainment and
  demography and suggests a relatively rapid evolution of factors determining the
  fine-scale localization of recombination in bread wheat.
