abstract: Honey bees, Apis mellifera, have experienced the full impacts of globalisation,
  including the recent invasion by the parasite Varroa destructor, hereafter called
  varroa. This deadly mite has rapidly become one of the main causes of colony losses
  worldwide, with a huge economic impact on beekeeping. Despite the lethal effects
  of varroa, some colonies survive infestation. In such colonies, honey bees are able
  to develop defence strategies that limit mite spread and confer colony resistance
  to varroa. In some populations, resistance traits were found to be sufficiently
  heritable to offer sustainable opportunities to fight varroa infestations through
  selective breeding of naturally resistant honey bees. Recent advances in genomics
  allow for the development of new tools to assess the importance of genetic mechanisms
  involved in varroa resistance. Here we report on the largest genome-wide association
  study performed on honey bees to understand the genetic basis of multiple phenotypes
  linked to varroa resistance in Apis mellifera. Genome wide association studies for
  varroa resistance traits were performed on whole genome sequencing of more than
  1,500 colonies belonging to three different genetic backgrounds and combined in
  a meta-analysis. Results show that varroa resistance is largely polygenic in nature,
  involving many genes with small effects. Still, a total of 60 genetic markers were
  identified as having a significant impact on varroa resistance in at least one of
  the honey bee populations tested. These associations pinpoint several regions of
  the honey bee genome that are linked with varroa resistance phenotypes and increase
  our understanding of the mechanisms underlying honey bee resistance to its main
  parasite. Our results will also support the building of strategies for genomic selection
  in honey bee breeding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing
  interest.
