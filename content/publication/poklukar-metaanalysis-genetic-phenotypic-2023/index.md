abstract: Intense selection of modern pig breeds has resulted in genetic improvement
  of production traits while the performance of local pig breeds has remained lower.
  As local pig breeds have been bred in extensive systems, they have adapted to specific
  environmental conditions, resulting in a rich genotypic and phenotypic diversity.
  This study is based on European local pig breeds that have been genetically characterized
  using DNA-pool sequencing data and phenotypically characterized using breed level
  phenotypes related to stature, fatness, growth, and reproductive performance traits.
  These data were analyzed using a dedicated approach to detect signatures of selection
  linked to phenotypic traits in order to uncover potential candidate genes that may
  underlie adaptation to specific environments.
