abstract: In the current context of worldwide honey bee colony losses, among which
  the varroa mite plays a major role, hope to improve honey bee health lies in part
  in the breeding of varroa resistant colonies. To do so, methods used to evaluate
  varroa resistance need better understanding. Repeatability and correlations between
  traits such as Mite Non-Reproduction (MNR), Varroa Sensitive Hygiene (VSH) and hygienic
  behaviour are poorly known, due to practical limitations and to their underlying
  complexity. We investigate (i) the variability, (ii) repeatability of the MNR score
  and (iii) its correlation with other resistance traits. To reduce the inherent variability
  of MNR scores, we propose to apply an Empirical Bayes correction. On the short-term
  (ten days) MNR had a modest repeatability of 0.4 whereas on the long- term (a month)
  it had a low repeatability of 0.2, similar to other resistance traits. Within our
  dataset there was no correlation between MNR and VSH. Although MNR is amongst the
  most popular varroa resistance estimates in field studies, its underlying complex
  mechanism is not fully understood. Its lack of correlation with better described
  resistance traits and low repeatability suggest that MNR need to be interpreted
  cautiously, especially when used for selection.
