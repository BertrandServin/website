abstract: Background Eusocial insects play a central role in many ecosystems, and
  particularly the important pollinator honeybee (Apis mellifera). One approach to
  facilitate their study in molecular genetics, is to consider whole colonies as single
  individuals by combining DNA of multiple individuals in a single pool sequencing
  experiment. Such a technique comes with the drawback of producing data requiring
  dedicated analytical methods to be fully exploited. Despite this limitation, pool
  sequencing data has been shown to be informative and cost-effective when working
  on random mating populations. Here, we present new statistical methods for exploiting
  pool sequencing data of eusocial colonies in order to reconstruct the genotype of
  the colony founder, the queen. This leverages the possibility to monitor genetic
  diversity, perform genomic-based studies or implement selective breeding.Results
  Using simulations and honeybee real data, we show that the methods allow for a fast
  and accurate estimation of the genetic ancestry, with correlations of 0.9 with that
  obtained from individual genotyping, and for an accurate reconstruction of the queen
  genotype, with 2% genotyping error. We further validate the inference using experimental
  data on colonies with both pool sequencing and individual genotyping of drones.Conclusion
  In this study we present statistical models to accurately estimate the genetic ancestry
  and reconstruct the genotype of the queen from pool sequencing data from workers
  of an eusocial colony. Such information allows to exploit pool sequencing for traditional
  population genetics, association studies and selective breeding. While validated
  in Apis mellifera, these methods are applicable to other eusocial hymenoptera species.Competing
