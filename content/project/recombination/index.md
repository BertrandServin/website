Genetic recombination is a fundamental biological process that ensures
proper chromosomal segregation during the reduction division of
meiosis. During recombination, homologous chromosomes exchange genetic
material through crossing-overs. These events lead to breaking the
parental allelic associations and can create new combination of
alleles in the offspring. This makes recombination one of the drivers
of the evolution of genetic diversity in populations.

The distribution of crossing-overs in a population of gametes is not
homogeneous along a chromosome : some genomic regions _recombine_ more
than others, meaning that the probability that they are involved in a
crossover event is higher. This probability is measured in terms of
their _recombination rate_ wich is expressed in Morgans (expected
number of crossovers) per base (unit of physicical distance along a
DNA molecule) or more usually in centiMorgans (hundredth of Morgans)
per megabase (millions of base pairs). Knowing the distribution of
recombination rates along the genome is important because it allows to
understand the constraints on the transmission of alleles from parent
to offspring. These constraints are fundamental in many applications
of genetics such as for the interpretation of observed allelic
associations in populations, the association between genetic 
and phenotypic variation or for predicting the outcome of selection.

Large scale genotyping of families and populations allows to estimate
precisely recombination rates along the genome. This approach revealed
that there is substantial inter-individual variation on recombination
rates and that part of this variation is due to genetic factors. We
have contributed to studying this question in sheep. By analysing data
obtained from genomics selection programs, we have mapped tens of
thousands of crossovers along the sheep genome and showed that there
is substantial heritability to the number of crossovers per
meiosis. We were able to discover a few genomic regions that harbour
mutations associated with this genetic variability.
