Species evolve constantly over time as individuals are born, reproduce
and die. Doing so their genomes pass on from parents to offspring,
modified by mutations and shuffled through [recombination]({{< relref
"project/recombination">}}). Constraints placed on the ability of
individuals to survive in their environment, to chose their mates, to
produce surviving offspring ... will impact the way genomes change
over time. In return, patterns of diversity observed in present day
genomes carry information on these constraints and therefore on the
evolutionary history of populations in the past and on biological
processes that affect the way genomes are transmitted. The field of
population genomics aims at developping new ways to interpret genetic
data recorded on whole genomes in order to gain insight into the past
history of populations and to apply them to one's favourite species.
