In colloboration with our colleagues from the Honeybee genomics group
in GenPhySE, we develop new statitical methods for analysing genetic
and phenotypic data in honeybee populations. The peculiarity of this
species is that the phenotypicaly and geneticly relevant unit of
observation is the colony made of one inseminated queen and thousands
of daughters. We develop statistical method to describe and exploit
the genetic and to some extent phenotypic diversity of colonies to
understand the evolutionary history and genetic architecture of traits
of this peculiar domesticated speices.

This collaboration initiated by a
[CASDAR](https://chambres-agriculture.fr/recherche-innovation/programmes-rd/programmes-casdar/)
project and followed by a large scale FranceAgrimer project to survey
/Varroa/ resistance in French colonies (see [ITSAP blog

[Labogena](http://www.labogena.fr/fr)
